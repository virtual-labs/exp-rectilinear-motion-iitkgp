### About the Experiment 

Rectilinear motion is another name for straight-line motion. This type of motion describes the movement of a particle or a body.The experimental control system in practical laboratory is comprised of the electromechanical plant which consists of the spring/mass mechanism, its actuator and sensors and a subsystem 
i.e. the executive program which runs on a PC under the DOS or Windows operating system.&nbsp;
This experiment use (encoder) Counts as the system units of position.
