### About the Experiment 
**System description**

Rectilinear motion is another name for straight-line motion. This type of motion describes the movement of a particle or a body. The experimental control system in practical laboratory is comprised of the electromechanical plant which consists of the spring/mass mechanism, its actuator, sensors and a subsystem 
i.e. an operating program or software which runs on a PC . This experiment use (encoder) counts as the system units of position, where the counts correspond to the encoder pulses and controller-internal register values.
