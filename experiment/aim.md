### Aim of the experiment
1. To study about Rectilinear motion of a Mass Spring Damper system.<br/>
2. To observe Open Loop Step response for different masses in the Mass Spring Damper system.<br/>
3. To identify the plant parameters (Mass of the carriage(Mc),Spring Constant(K),Damping Coefficient(C)).</b><br/>
4. To calculate approximate hardware gain of the system.
