### Aim of the experiment
1. To study about Rectilinear motion of a Mass Spring Damper system.

2. To observe Open Loop Step response for different masses in the Mass Spring Damper system.

3. To identify the plant parameters (Mass of the carriage (M<sub>c</sub>), Spring Constant (K), Damping Coefficient (C) ).

4. To calculate approximate hardware gain of the system.
